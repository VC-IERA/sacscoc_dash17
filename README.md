Code written by http://mattwiley.org/publications.html 


I need to get a couple more eyes on this code, but I don't want to cheat folks of information so:

1) I removed a lot of junk code

2) this code won't run because I'm not quite ready to share the data set behind it. While I'd anonymised and randomised grades and some other data, I need a bit more time to make sure I'm being cautious with institutional data.

3) all that being said, you do have the whole code. All that is needed is a data file to power some of it.

4) while I do need some time to work through this, please do not feel shy about sending me an email if you've questions. I enjoy questions, and I'll get back to you!
